# 🌍 Life Expectancy Analysis

This project explores global life expectancy trends using both **Power BI** and **Python** (via a Jupyter Notebook). It combines data visualization and statistical analysis to understand the influence of socioeconomic and health-related factors on life expectancy across different countries and time periods.

## 📌 Project Components

### 1. 📊 Power BI Dashboard
- Visualizes key indicators like:
  - Life expectancy by country and region
  - GDP per capita
  - Health expenditure
  - Population trends
- Interactive filters to explore:
  - Country comparisons
  - Trends over time
  - Regional performance

### 2. 📓 Jupyter Notebook (Python)
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Visualized relationships between:
  - Life expectancy & GDP
  - Life expectancy & health expenditure
  - Mortality and education levels

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- NumPy

---

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle - Life Expectancy Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) and includes data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations.

---

## 📈 Insights & Findings
- Countries with higher GDP and health expenditure tend to have higher life expectancy.
- Education and immunization coverage are strong positive indicators.
- Mortality rate and disease prevalence negatively affect life expectancy.
